## Other notable changes

- {{< apiref IFluidContainer >}}s have a new property,
  [isDirty]({{< relref "FluidContainer.md#fluid-framework-ifluidcontainer-isdirty-PropertySignature" >}}), which will be true if
  the container has outstanding operations that have not been acknowledged by the Fluid service. Using this property
  correctly can help prevent data loss due to service connectivity issues ({{< issue 7891 >}}).

  See [isDirty in the Fluid container documentation]({{< relref "containers.md#isDirty" >}}) for more information.
